## Description

This is a project I did in Python for one of our courses at Alzahra University alongside another student.

In this project, we scraped IMDB website and found its top 100 movies. First we extracted each movie's link. 
Then we extracted each movie's storyline and we defined important keywords in each storyline using TextRank algorithm.
Finally, we created a weighted graph for movies. Each node is a movie, and each edge is a representation of common keywords.
Then we stored the graph in a text file, available in the repository.
